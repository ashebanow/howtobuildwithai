# How to build with AI

There is nothing special in here. No magic.

Some people treat prompting coding agents as this sacred art with hand-crafted prompts for every new task they do. Others dump some random thoughts into the input and pray for the best.

Build once, use forever.

In here, I put my slash commands, hooks, tools, configurations that work for me. That work across languages and projects.

A lot of people say "you could prompt the model to do it."

Yeah. I could. But I don't want to. I don't want the agent to first waste tokens to write a GraphQL query that fails the first few times so it can get the inline commands from a PR. The agent should spend it's brain power (it's token) only on the thing that matters. I am happy to write the scripts that do the plumbing.
